Content Encoding:

I did prefer using deflate encoding when the user agent did send

	Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate

because it costs a bit less in cpu usage and bandwidth. Well, I had
to change this when I did a test with the bogosity from Redmond they
call a browser. This beast happily sends the above line and when
it then gets delivered a deflated page it just renders an empty page.
