The following sample templates are available:

minimal.tmpl	- minimalistic without any real layout
minimoz.tmpl	- somewhat similar to dmoz.org
stylesheet.tmpl	- xhtml with stylesheet, my personal favorite

The template outputs were developed using Mozilla/Unix, then checked for
W3C compliance and finally carefully modified to render also in the
brainless bogosity from Redmond they call a browser.

As for the images except for minimoz.gif these were taken either from
dmoz.org (star.gif) or gif collections on the web. It may be necessary
to check for copyrights if you're going to use these images in a
production environment. minimoz.gif is (c) 2004 Andreas Steinmetz,
